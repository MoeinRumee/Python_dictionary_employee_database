# codeSignal_ex_employee_database

n our HR system, we maintain an employee database. Each employee is assigned a unique ID, and their role is tracked against this ID in a Python dictionary, which constitutes our hash table. Your task is to create an initial database with various roles, then simulate a scenario involving a promotion and an employee departure while updating the database accordingly.

Remember, this requires the addition, retrieval, and deletion operations that we've learned about in addition to the time complexity analysis for these operations. Good luck!
